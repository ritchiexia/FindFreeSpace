# [FindFreeSpace](http://www.findfree.space/)

## Project Description
When searching for a study room at UBC, it can be difficult to find one that is empty. Normally, you have to pick a building without knowing if any of the rooms are available! With findfree.space, you can select which building to look at, and then check the vacancy of every room. Alternatively, FFS shows the number of occupants in the room, if you don't mind just a little bit of company.

This repository holds the code for upper body detection, and refreshes the count every 30 seconds. The other components of the project can be found here:
* [Front End](https://github.com/eeseee/findfreespace-client)
